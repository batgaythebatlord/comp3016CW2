This is the project for comp 3016 CW2. It is a 3D scene render in C++ using ASSIMP and OpenGL libraries. This scene is a procedural generation of terrain with green hills and low-lying white to represent clouds in the valleys. There is a 3D model of a rock in the scene, with textures. The project makes no use of generative AI tools, and none were used in its development.
